HI Jeff,

For New web service development (REST style), I would suggest below best practices for web services because I can see below points are the pains points in GTI webservices:


1. We should support both JSON/XML (But JSON should be first choice over xml because, it is lightweight interms of size/parsing).

2. We should validation the request w.r.t. to its prediffened schema. (It will really helps for unnesaary data issues and validation error on service/data later).

3. While parsing the xml/json if we are using jaxb or any framework we should go with sax parser implementation. (In terms of memory it is very effiecient).
   Note: Currently in GTI dom parser is used. And for heavy xml, memory cosumptions are large. I already validate in yourkit tool.

4. We should support two types syncrounus web service:
   a. Syncrounus web service with full response return at a one time (Current implementation).
   b. Syncrounus web service with chunked output.
      Note: 
       1. It will be used is response is very large. (like in GTI)
       2. It shouldbe in implemented  description manner like just add one annotation to it. (This will require a build liitle framework)

5. Design rest URLs in a way that one resource/webservice will do only one operation.
   Note: Currently in GTI one rest service doing almost all the operations. Hence JUNIT will be more complex.

6. Below are the layer should be used:
   Security Layer (Missing in GTI)
   Controller/Resource layer
   Validation Layer for business validation (Missing in GTI)
   Service Layer
   Data Layer

7. We should add any application security layer (basic auth, oAuth etc.)  for access the rest/web services.
   Note: Currently anybody can access GTI web service.

Jeff, Above are just my suggestions. Whats your thoughts on this? 

Thanks
Arpan
